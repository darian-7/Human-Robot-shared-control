# human-robot
Worked one-to-one with Dr. Dandan Zhang from the University of Bristol exploring human-robot interaction. Conducted robotic arm simulations on CoppeliaSim that followed a script that I programmed on Python. Programmed Python code that uses OpenCV library for facial recognition to remotely control a robot.
